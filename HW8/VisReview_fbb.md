Your plot uses a red-green scheme which is not color-blind compliant. The amount of information is large, and the correlation matrix looses power because of the large number of cells. If you want to show a correlation matrix with such large number of cells you should order the cells by some meaningful pattern. The abbreviationsa re not parsable. since the matrix repeats identical information on the upper-triangular and lower-triangular part a better use of space would be to only plot the lower-triangular and to put the legend in the now empty half og the plot.
