## Comments on uZubair's Visualization
1. The plot is very visually appealing to me, but it uses a very red-green heavy colormap. This would cause issues for those with red-green colorblindness
2. It is not very clear what the features are in this plot. Maybe you can elaborate in the caption?
3. Are there any big take-aways from this chart? I find it very pretty, but I do not see any conclusions jumping out at me, so I would appreciate if your caption explained it more.
