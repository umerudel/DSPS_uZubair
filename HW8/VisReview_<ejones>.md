Clarity: The plot is fairly easy to read and very concsice but may not be freindly to viewers who don't know all the abbreviations. 
Perhaps splitting it into smaller plots with more full captions would be helpful.

Aesthetic: The plot does however fairly clearly communicate I believe what aspects of the car you give up when maximizing any given aspect
so as a chart attempting to maximize say mpg it's very clear to me what other aspects i can't maximize.

Colors: the colors are okay but sligtly hard to view in the deutranopia filter especially the difference between .8-.5 
perhaps change the colors used. It looked fine in tritinopia though.

My final suggestion might be a legend across the bottom to outline each of the full captions.
